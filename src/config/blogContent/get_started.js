const p1 = `Getting started with NLP (Natural Language Processing) 
    can be a daunting task, especially if you are new to the field. 
    But fear not! With the right tools and mindset, you can begin your 
    NLP journey and start building useful applications in no time.`

const p2 = `First and foremost, it's important to understand what NLP 
    is and what it can do. Simply put, NLP is a branch of artificial 
    intelligence that deals with processing and understanding human 
    language. With NLP, you can build applications that can analyze, 
    interpret, and generate human language. This opens up a world of 
    possibilities, from chatbots and virtual assistants to sentiment 
    analysis and machine translation.`

const p3 = `Here are a few things to keep in mind to get started with 
    NLP:`

const p4 = `- Learn some programming: NLP is a field that requires a 
    lot of programming skills, especially in Python. You'll need to 
    know how to work with data structures, manipulate strings, and 
    perform statistical analysis.`

const p5 = `- Choose your tools: There are plenty of NLP tools and 
    libraries out there, such as spaCy, NLTK, and TextBlob. Each has 
    its own strengths and weaknesses, so it's worth experimenting with 
    a few to find the one that works best for you.`

const p6 = `- Start small: Don't try to build a complex NLP application 
    right away. Instead, start with a simple project, such as a 
    sentiment analysis tool or a chatbot that can answer basic 
    questions. This will help you get a feel for the tools and 
    techniques involved in NLP.`

const p7 = `Once you've got the basics down, you can start to explore 
    more advanced topics, such as deep learning and neural networks. 
    But remember, NLP is a constantly evolving field, so be prepared 
    to keep learning and adapting as new techniques and tools emerge.`
